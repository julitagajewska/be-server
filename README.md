# Personal Budget API Server
This repository contains a simple API server built using Express.js to handle the backend operations for the Personal Budget Management applications. The server communicates with a MongoDB database to store and manage financial data.
The API server provides endpoints for CRUD operations, allowing the frontend applications (available here: [clients' repo](https://github.com/julitagajewska/be-budget-management)) to retrieve, create, update, and delete data related to personal budgets.
